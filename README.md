# Thinking first
The requirements:
1. multiple (two or three) sizes of ellipses
2. non-overlapping shapes
3. not in straight lines

I'll start by drawing one set of random circles of random sizes. 
Wait, having random-size circles is easy (by using random). What's difficult is the different-position pieces and not overlapping. Let me try out how to make that happen first. I'll write a for loop.

Wow, it's not random enough. 

# 1st experiment
I began experimenting with xyz of the for loop a bit, given I'm a little lost in the class notes. At last, I picked up how to use random to give random x & y pisitions for points. It now looks like:
